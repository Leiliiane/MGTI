The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, especially Large Language Models (LLM), has made an impact on various domains, and may also shift the focus of digital library services from storing and preserving information to utilizing and extracting knowledge from that information. We expect to add value created by LLMs to existing digital library methods so that users can better leverage the information stored in digital library collections. This research aims to improve access to digital library collections by providing users with classification labels and summaries to help easily find their works of interest leveraging large language models. Two expected major benefits are: (1) Enhancing metadata in the form of classification labels, which will help users discover and use digital library collections more easily. (2) Providing summaries of works stored in the digital library to aid researchers in finding works of interest without having to read the entire content, which will help remediate the information overload problem.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Artificial intelligence; Digital libraries; Machine learning; Natural language processing","Digital libraries; Artificial intelligence technologies; Classification labels; Digital library collections; Language model; Language processing; Library methods; Library services; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Classification (of information)","","","","","","","Byrne A., Digital libraries: Barriers or gateways to scholarly information?, The Electronic Library, 21, 5, pp. 414-421, (2003); Choi K., Computational thematic analysis of poetry via bimodal large language models, Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology 60, 1, 2023, pp. 538-542, (2023); Chowdhury G.G., Chowdhury S., Introduction to digital libraries, Facet Publishing, (2003); Hu Y., Jiang M., Underwood T., Stephen Downie J., Improving digital libraries? provision of digital humanities datasets: A case study of htrc literature dataset, Proceedings of the ACM/ IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries in 2020, pp. 405-408, (2020); Jiang M., Dubnicek R.C., Worthey G., Underwood T., Stephen Downie J., A prototype Gutenberg-Hathitrust sentence-level parallel corpus for OCR error analysis: Pilot investigations, Proceedings of the 22nd ACM/ IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries, pp. 1-5, (2022); Jiang M., Hu Y., Worthey G., Dubnicek R.C., Underwood T., Stephen Downie J., Evaluating BERT's Encoding of Intrinsic Semantic Features of OCR'd Digital Library Collections, 2021 ACM/ IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL).

To develop new skills in the area of developing and implementing artificial intelligence technologies, there is a need to review strategies and methods of teaching at all levels of education. The article analyses the best practices in the application of digital technology across sectors of the AI economy, including transportation, industry, healthcare, and others. It also discusses the content of the ""Artificial Intelligence Systems""discipline, which aims to develop methods for solving professional and social issues using AI. The article proposes ways to teach students how to explore and apply ""smart""approaches to solving professional and everyday problems. The methodology for organizing students' activities when completing a project task to create a smart greenhouse is described. Students work in teams to design technical devices that automatically maintain the normal value of certain parameters (humidity, temperature, lighting, etc.); test them using simulators and software tools; install working models; and make technological forecasts about the possibilities of using artificial intelligence to optimize processes. © 2025 Author(s).","","","","","","","","","Krutova I.A., Krutova O.V., Information Society, 6, pp. 69-76, (2023); Ivliev G.P., Egorova M.A., Journal of Russian Law, 26, 6, pp. 32-46, (2022); Kamalov K.F., Sokolov O.A., Vestnik Nauki, 11, 68, pp. 896-901, (2023); Adamova A., Zhukabayeva T., Ven-Tsen Kh., Bulletin of L.

However, these scholarly writings are often laden with jargon and tailored for domain experts rather than the general public. As librarians, we strive to offer services to a diverse audience, including those with lower reading levels. To extend our services beyond mere access, we propose fine-Tuning a language model to rewrite scholarly abstracts into more comprehensible versions, thereby making scholarly literature more accessible when requested. We began by introducing a corpus specifically designed for training models to simplify scholarly abstracts. This corpus consists of over three thousand pairs of abstracts and significance statements from diverse disciplines. We then fine-Tuned four language models using this corpus. The outputs from the models were subsequently examined both quantitatively for accessibility and semantic coherence, and qualitatively for language quality, faithfulness, and completeness. Our findings show that the resulting models can improve readability by over three grade levels compared to the original abstracts, while maintaining fidelity to the original content. Although commercial state-of-Theart models still hold an edge, our models are much more compact, can be deployed locally in an affordable manner, and alleviate the privacy concerns associated with using commercial models. We envision this work as a step toward more accessible libraries, improving our services for young readers and those without advanced degrees.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Accessible language; Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Language model; Text simplification","Contrastive Learning; Deep learning; Accessible language; Deep learning; Domain experts; Fine tuning; General publics; Knowledge dissemination; Language model; Reading level; Scientific literature; Text simplification; Semantics","","","","","University Information Technology Research Cyberinfrastructure; Montana State University, MSU; Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS, (RE-246450-OLS-20); Institute of Museum and Library Services, IMLS","We are grateful for the support from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) under grant RE-246450-OLS-20.

A thorough analysis of these policies on a global scale is important for guiding educational innovation and ensuring the effectiveness of technology applications. This article uses a content analysis method, taking 26 artificial intelligence education policies from major countries and international organizations as samples, and employs a”policy tool—policy content” two-dimensional analysis framework to quantitatively analyze the policy texts to reveal the characteristics of international artificial intelligence education policies. The study finds that the current types of policy tools are mainly supply-oriented and environmental-oriented, focusing more on dimensions such as quality assessment and assurance, resource environment construction, and future talent cultivation in terms of content elements. Supply-side tools provide resource support for the construction of intelligent educational environments and innovative cultivation services for the improvement of teachers’ and students’ intelligent literacy; environmental tools build institutional standards for the quality assurance of intelligent education and create organizational strategies to achieve inclusive and fair education. Finally, the study proposes suggestions for the formulation and optimization of artificial intelligence education policies from four aspects: strengthening talent cultivation, focusing on independent research and development, deepening international exchanges, and systematic policy design, to promote the high-quality development of teaching and education in the digital age. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Artificial Intelligence Education; Content Analysis Method; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Policy Texts; Policy Tools","Artificial intelligence education; Content analysis method; Education policies; Generative artificial intelligence; International organizations; International perspective; Policy analysis; Policy text; Policy tools; Talent cultivations","","","","","Huiyan International College, Faculty of Education; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62207003); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC; Beijing Normal University, BNU, (2023HICR0004); Beijing Normal University, BNU","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) No.62207003 and Research Project of Huiyan International College, Faculty of Education, Beijing Normal University 2023HICR0004.","Di Lu, Shifei Duan, Ke Hu, Fuhua Li, Yizhou Chen, Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence Education: Framework, Challenges and Changes, Journal of Distance Education, 38, pp. 3-12, (2020); Shifei Duan, Guoqin Gong, Application Policies of Artificial Intelligence Education from the Perspective of International Comparison, Modern Educational Technology, 29, pp. 11-17, (2019); Pin Sun, Yu Jiang, Ten-year Review and Retrospect of Intelligent Education Policy in China, Modern Educational Technology, 32, 12, pp. 68-75, (2022); Shuaijie Wang, Qianwen Tang, Qiguang Yang, International Observations on the Application of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education: Challenges, Countermeasures and Reflections, e-Education Research, 45, pp. 106-112, (2024); Wen Wang, Yongzhi Li, Development and Reflection on International Generative Artificial Intelligence Application in Education, Open Education Research, 30, 3, pp. 37-44, (2024); Rothwell R., Zegveld W., An Assessment of Government Innovation Policies, Policy Research Review, pp. 19-35, (1988); Hao Guo, Nan Jiang, Hong Jiang, Liu Zhonghua, Huiying Deng, The Ethical Risks of Al-Driver Educational Reform and the Ways to De-risk Them, e-Education Research, 4, pp. 25-31, (2024); Yonghe Wu, Bowen Liu, Xiaoling Ma, Constructing an Ecosystem of”Artificial Intelligence + Education, Journal of Distance Education, 35, pp. 27-39, (2017); Cixiao Wang, Junyan Xu, Liming Guo, Qinhua Zheng, Research on the of Evaluation Framework of Multi-scene Human-machine Collaborative Online Teaching-Based on the Analyses of Analytic Hierarchy Process and Entropy Weight Method, Modern Educational Technology, 33, pp. 74-82, (2023); Zhou Jing, QiGuang Yang, Risks and Countermeasures AIGC Enabling Paradigm Change in Educational Research: Mechanisms, China Educational Technology, pp. 68-75, (2024)","C.

Blended teaching has become essential in adapting to the educational advancements of the digital intelligence era. The deep integration of digital intelligence technology and classroom teaching has become the new norm of education and teaching reform. As the core technology of artificial intelligence (AI), a knowledge graph can express the knowledge system visually, integrate educational resources, collect learning process data to realize the monitoring and diagnosis of the learning process and meet the diversified needs of intelligent education applications. It is an effective tool for deeply integrating nursing education and AI. As healthcare technology continues to evolve and knowledge is rapidly updated, students need to continually learn and update their knowledge base so as to keep up with professional development. Therefore, this study explored the practical strategy of digital–intelligent blended teaching of Surgical Nursing by reshaping and integrating the course content, sorting out the course knowledge system, and constructing the course knowledge graph to enable students to systematically master the learning content and access high-quality learning resources. It provided a reference for the digital transformation of higher education, with a view to promoting the consolidation of students’ mastery of basic knowledge, improving students’ clinical thinking and comprehensive ability to implement holistic care for patients, and cultivating students’ ability to acquire and use cutting-edge knowledge. © 2025 The Authors.","Blended teaching;
