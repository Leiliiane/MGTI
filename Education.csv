Aim: To develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale specifically for Turkish nurses. Method: This methodological study was conducted between October 2024 and December 2024, and its sample consisted of 678 nurses working in Turkey. The item pool was developed through a comprehensive literature review. Data analysis included descriptive statistics, item analysis, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, as well as assessments of convergent and divergent validity, correlation analysis, internal consistency reliability, and test-retest reliability. Results: The content validity index for the items ranged from 0.85 to 1.00. Exploratory factor analysis revealed that the eigenvalues for four factors were greater than one, and these four factors accounted for 77.28% of the total variance. The scale demonstrated an acceptable model fit, with a goodness of fit index of 0.921 and a root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.064. Cronbach’s alpha coefficients ranged from 0.93 to 0.95 across the subscales, indicating high internal consistency, with the scale showing convergent and divergent validity. In addition, the Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale for Nurses was found to have high test-retest reliability. This study may offer valuable insights into nurses’ attitudes toward digital technologies, thereby informing the trajectory of digital transformation in healthcare services. © The Author(s) 2025.","Artificial intelligence; Attitude; Nurses; Psychometric evaluation; Scale development","","","","","","","","Ricciardi W., Assessing the impact of digital transformation of health services: opinion by the expert panel on effective ways of investing in health, Eur J Public Health, 29, (2019); Al-Kahtani N., Alruwaie S., Al-Zahrani B.M., Abumadini R.A., Aljaafary A., Hariri B., Et al., Digital health transformation in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional analysis using healthcare information and management systems society’ digital health indicators, Digit Heal, 8, (2022); Muthappan S., Elumalai R., Shanmugasundaram N., Johnraja N., Prasath H., Ambigadoss P., Et al., AYUSH digital initiatives: Harnessing the power of digital technology for India’s traditional medical systems, J Ayurveda Integr Med, 13, (2022); Dhingra D., Dabas A., Global strategy on digital health, Indian Pediatr, 57, pp. 356-358, (2020); Robert N., How artificial intelligence is changing nursing, Nurs Manage, 50, (2019); Kotp M.H., Ismail H.A., Basyouny H.A.A., Aly M.A., Hendy A., Nashwan A.J., Et al., Empowering nurse leaders: readiness for AI integration and the perceived benefits of predictive analytics, BMC Nurs, 24, (2025); WHO.

It has become a new engine to promote the innovation and development of the civic education model. Digital and intellectual technology-enabled university civic and political education model can carry the concept of innovation through the subject, content, process, and scene of education and promote the development of the ideological and political parenting model in the direction of refinement, specialization, and conscientization. Based on the differential game model, this paper comprehensively considers the model characteristics of universities, enterprises, and governments and their intertemporal characteristics of collaborative parenting and innovation behaviors. It constructs the no-incentive, cost-sharing, and collaborative cooperation models, respectively, and obtains the optimal trajectories for the degree of effort, the subsidy coefficient, the optimal benefit function, and the digital and intelligent technology stock. The conclusions are as follows: (1) resource input cost and technological innovation cost are the key driving variables of university ideological and political parenting; (2) the government’s cost subsidy improves the degree of innovation effort of universities and enterprises, and thus achieves Pareto optimality for the three parties; (3) the degree of innovation effort, overall benefit and technology level of the three parties in the synergistic cooperation model is better than that of the other two models. Finally, the validity of the model is verified through numerical simulation analysis. An in-depth discussion of the digital intelligence-enabled ideological and political parenting model is necessary for the high-quality development of education, which helps improve the scientific and practical ideological and political parenting in the digital age. © The Author(s) 2025.","Differential game; Digital intelligence; Dynamic optimization; Ideological and political parenting models; Innovation system","article; artificial intelligence; big data; child parent relation; cloud computing; controlled study; educational model; empowerment; game; government; human; incentive; intelligence; pareto optimality; simulation; specialization; validity; adult","","","","","2023 Basic Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education, (JYTMS20230464); Liaoning Province Education Science, (JG22DB085)","This work was supported by 2023 Basic Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education - Surface project \u201CResearch on the Inheritance Path of Excellent Traditional Chinese Culture from the Perspective of Cultural Confidence\u201D (Project number: JYTMS20230464) and Liaoning Province Education Science \u201C14th Five-Year Plan\u201D project in 2022 general project \u201CResearch on the Reform and Innovation of\u201D Situation and Policy \u201CCourse from the Perspective of New Media\u201D (project approval number: JG22DB085).","Mihai L., Et al., A systematic analysis of new approaches to digital economic education based on the use of AI technologies, Amfiteatru Econ, 26, 65, pp. 201-219, (2024); Yang G.P., Et al., Impact of digital globalization on health behavior through integration of ideological and political education in schools leading to the spirit for fighting against COVID-19, Amer J.

While these tools suggest substantive implications for content creation, educators question whether they belong in classrooms and raise concerns regarding academic integrity and plagiarism. However, GAI can be powerful tools for creating content in a classroom environment where students learn to interact with GAI better to understand the limitations and possibilities of this medium. Substantively introducing GAI in an English classroom comes with risks; however, not doing so may deprive students of skills needed for future careers. We need to change how we view the role of GAI in the classroom so that our students are better prepared for the twenty-first-century workplace. “Digital Literacy and Artificial Intelligence” is an upper-level undergraduate class created for English majors interested in GAI.

Materials and methods: A team of oral and maxillofacial surgeons developed a pool of open-ended questions de novo. The validity of the questions was assessed using Lawshe’s Content Validity Index. The questions, which focused on systemic diseases and common conditions that may raise concerns during oral surgery, were presented to ChatGPT 3.5 and Claude-instant in two separate sessions, spaced one week apart. Two experienced maxillofacial surgeons, blinded to the chatbots, assessed the responses for quality, accuracy, and completeness using a modified DISCERN tool and Likert scale. Intraclass correlation, Mann-Whitney U test, skewness, and kurtosis coefficients were employed to compare the performances of the chatbots. Results: Most responses were high quality: 86% and 79.6% for ChatGPT, and 81.25% and 89% for Claude-instant in sessions 1 and 2, respectively. In terms of accuracy, ChatGPT had 92% and 93.4% of its responses rated as completely correct in sessions 1 and 2, respectively, while Claude-instant had 95.2% and 89%. For completeness, ChatGPT had 88.5% and 86.8% of its responses rated as adequate or comprehensive in sessions 1 and 2, respectively, while Claude-instant had 95.2% and 86%. Conclusion: Ongoing software developments and the increasing acceptance of chatbots among healthcare professionals hold promise that these tools can provide rapid solutions to the high demand for medical care, ease professionals’ workload, reduce costs, and save time. © The Author(s) 2025.","Artificial intelligence;

Developed collaboratively by an interdisciplinary team of university lecturers and AI experts, the bot provides a platform for students of different health study programs to engage in complex patient-health professional conversations, offering an alternative to traditional role plays with actors or real patients. Methods: This study utilized a GPT-4 based digital teaching assistant, implemented through a proprietary chatbot design platform, to train anamnesis interviews in virtual settings with students from different online health care study programs. Students’ satisfaction, virtual patient’s accuracy, its realism, and quality were evaluated with a quantitative survey. Results: The evaluation of the bot focused on student feedback, highlighting a preference for the AI-driven method due to its immersive and interactive nature. Preliminary results show that students consistently rate the language ability of the AI model positively. More than 80% of students rated the professional and content-related precision of the virtual patient as good to excellent. Even as a text-based chatbot, the vast majority of students see a fairly close to very close relationship to a real anamnesis interview. The results further indicate that students even prefer this training approach to traditional in-person role-plays. Conclusions: The study underscores the bot’s potential as a versatile tool for enriching learning experiences across multiple health disciplines, signaling a meaningful shift in educational practices towards the integration of AI technologies. © The Author(s) 2025.","Anamnesis interview; Artificial intelligence patients; ChatGPT; Health professionals; Large language model; Medical education; Self-directed learning","Artificial Intelligence; Education, Distance; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Role Playing; Surveys and Questionnaires; artificial intelligence; distance learning; female; human; interview; male; questionnaire; role playing","","","","","IU International University of Applied Sciences","This work was supported by IU International University of Applied Sciences Incubator funding (Ref.

Traditional 3D modeling methods are resource-intensive, while recent advances in Neural Rendering (NR) have introduced efficient and automated solutions. In the fashion industry, where visual fidelity and rapid prototyping are crucial, NR techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are becoming relevant resources to digitize complex geometries and textures with a low-cost approach, enabling different applications like virtual fitting rooms, immersive e-commerce, and digital prototyping. However, the evaluation of their effectiveness in this field is still in its early phases. To address the industry's needs, we propose Fashion immersive Neural Rendering Interface (FENRI), a novel framework that integrates NR techniques for reconstructing 3D models from 2D images of fashion items. FENRI includes a WebXR-based visualization platform that allows immersive comparison and evaluation of NR-generated 3D models, supporting both experts and non-experts in selecting optimal designs. We applied FENRI to footwear design, collecting a novel dataset to compare NeRF and 3DGS methods through quantitative and qualitative analyses. In our study, the 3DGS method demonstrated superior performance over NeRF, as highlighted by the higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values (37.65 vs. 29.03, respectively) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) scores (0.99 vs 0.96), while exhibiting a lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) values (0.01 vs 0.04). Moreover, we showed that, by applying classical mesh post-processing techniques, we can increase the topological and visual quality of the 3D models synthesized by NR methods. These findings highlight the potential of NR techniques in the fashion industry's digital pipeline. By enabling rapid, immersive, and visually compelling design iterations, FENRI offers a scalable solution to the fashion industry's demand for high-quality 3D reconstructions, promoting innovation and sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence system; Deep learning; Fashion garment design; Immersive visualization; Neural Rendering","Garment industry; Gaussian noise (electronic); Visualization; Artificial intelligence systems; Deep learning; Fashion garment design; Fashion industry; Garment design; Gaussians; Immersive; Immersive visualization; Neural rendering; Three dimensional modelling; Rendering (computer graphics)","","","","","","","Balloni E., Gorgoglione L., Paolanti M., Mancini A., Pierdicca R., Few shot photogrametry: A comparison between NERF and MVS-SFM for the documentation of cultural heritage, Int.

To inform the development of evidence-based strategies to protect children online, this study aimed to describe contemporary digital marketing techniques and industry reported impacts from unhealthy food and beverage marketing campaigns aimed at young people aged 3–17. We conducted a qualitative conceptual content analysis of 111 industry reports detailing the nature and impact of unhealthy food and beverage marketing campaigns from around the world that directly or indirectly targeted children through digital channels. We categorised and narratively describe how food and beverage companies are using digital marketing techniques, across four conceptual groups: (i) leveraging data and technology to optimise marketing, (ii) profiling and segmenting audiences, (iii) targeting and personalisation, and (iv) generating participation and engagement. Industry reported impacts on young people as a result of campaigns included i) increased exposure to, and engagement with, unhealthy food marketing, ii) purchases and consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages iii) formation of emotional brand connections and enhanced future marketing through data collection. Our findings support and extend existing literature revealing how multinational food and beverage companies are using advanced digital marketing techniques, including artificial intelligence and new technologies, to shape children's food behaviours and influence their diets worldwide. Policy actions are needed to protect children from the sophisticated digital marketing techniques used by the food and beverage industry. © 2025 The Authors","","","","","","","VicHealth; National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC, (APP2024716); National Health and Medical Research Council, NHMRC; National Heart Foundation of Australia, (106716, 102611); National Heart Foundation of Australia","There was no specific funding for this study.
