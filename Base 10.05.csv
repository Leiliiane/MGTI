It has become a new engine to promote the innovation and development of the civic education model. Digital and intellectual technology-enabled university civic and political education model can carry the concept of innovation through the subject, content, process, and scene of education and promote the development of the ideological and political parenting model in the direction of refinement, specialization, and conscientization. Based on the differential game model, this paper comprehensively considers the model characteristics of universities, enterprises, and governments and their intertemporal characteristics of collaborative parenting and innovation behaviors. It constructs the no-incentive, cost-sharing, and collaborative cooperation models, respectively, and obtains the optimal trajectories for the degree of effort, the subsidy coefficient, the optimal benefit function, and the digital and intelligent technology stock. The conclusions are as follows: (1) resource input cost and technological innovation cost are the key driving variables of university ideological and political parenting; (2) the government’s cost subsidy improves the degree of innovation effort of universities and enterprises, and thus achieves Pareto optimality for the three parties; (3) the degree of innovation effort, overall benefit and technology level of the three parties in the synergistic cooperation model is better than that of the other two models. Finally, the validity of the model is verified through numerical simulation analysis. An in-depth discussion of the digital intelligence-enabled ideological and political parenting model is necessary for the high-quality development of education, which helps improve the scientific and practical ideological and political parenting in the digital age. © The Author(s) 2025.","Differential game; Digital intelligence; Dynamic optimization; Ideological and political parenting models; Innovation system","article; artificial intelligence; big data; child parent relation; cloud computing; controlled study; educational model; empowerment; game; government; human; incentive; intelligence; pareto optimality; simulation; specialization; validity; adult","","","","","2023 Basic Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education, (JYTMS20230464); Liaoning Province Education Science, (JG22DB085)","This work was supported by 2023 Basic Scientific Research Project of Colleges and Universities of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education - Surface project \u201CResearch on the Inheritance Path of Excellent Traditional Chinese Culture from the Perspective of Cultural Confidence\u201D (Project number: JYTMS20230464) and Liaoning Province Education Science \u201C14th Five-Year Plan\u201D project in 2022 general project \u201CResearch on the Reform and Innovation of\u201D Situation and Policy \u201CCourse from the Perspective of New Media\u201D (project approval number: JG22DB085).","Mihai L., Et al., A systematic analysis of new approaches to digital economic education based on the use of AI technologies, Amfiteatru Econ, 26, 65, pp. 201-219, (2024); Yang G.P., Et al., Impact of digital globalization on health behavior through integration of ideological and political education in schools leading to the spirit for fighting against COVID-19, Amer J.

While these tools suggest substantive implications for content creation, educators question whether they belong in classrooms and raise concerns regarding academic integrity and plagiarism. However, GAI can be powerful tools for creating content in a classroom environment where students learn to interact with GAI better to understand the limitations and possibilities of this medium. Substantively introducing GAI in an English classroom comes with risks; however, not doing so may deprive students of skills needed for future careers. We need to change how we view the role of GAI in the classroom so that our students are better prepared for the twenty-first-century workplace. “Digital Literacy and Artificial Intelligence” is an upper-level undergraduate class created for English majors interested in GAI. The course teaches students skills for collaborating with GAI by using a collaboration log to document their interactions with GAI. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

This paper aims to analyze the impact and mechanisms of AI on content creators' self-actualization, especially how it works in fast-changing environments, and to present AI-driven knowledge management (KM) strategies as an integrated approach for optimizing this process. A quantitative survey method was used to collect data from 684 content creators across various new media platforms in China, followed by empirical analysis using PLS-SEM. The study findings show that the adoption of AI positively influences self-actualization in dynamic environments by enhancing creators' abilities to explore, share, and exploit knowledge. In this process, knowledge exploitation is an obvious shortcoming that should be prioritized for improvement, while knowledge exploration is a strength among content creators that should be maintained and further developed, and knowledge sharing should be moderately integrated into the workflow. By proposing and bridging an AI-KM model of interaction and symbiosis and a self-actualization framework in creative contexts, the paper is the first effort to explore the interplay between AI, KM processes, and self-actualization, filling a gap in existing research. The results offer actionable strategies for creators and managers in creative industries to promote human-machine interaction and personal values and provide an inclusive and collaborative practical path for enhancing the role of technology in human creativity. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial Intelligence; Content creators; Creative industries; Dynamic environment; Knowledge management; Self-actualization","China; Changing environment; Content creators; Creative industries; Creatives; Digital economy; Dynamic environments; Knowledge management strategy; Personal growth; Self-actualization; Work-flows; artificial intelligence; creative industry; knowledge; management","","","","","Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, MOE; Excellent Expert; University of Queensland, UQ; Fudan University, FDU; National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS, (18AGL024); National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences, NPOPSS; Sichuan University, SCU, (2023ZDPY-05); Sichuan University, SCU","Funding text 1: Yongzhong Yang, male, Professor of Creative Management, Ph.D. in Economics from Sichuan University, Postdoctoral Fellow from Fudan University, Visiting Scholar from the University of Queensland under the State Sending Program, Support Program for New Century Excellent Talents of the Ministry of Education (in the direction of Creative Management), and Excellent Expert with Outstanding Contributions in Sichuan Province.

Developed collaboratively by an interdisciplinary team of university lecturers and AI experts, the bot provides a platform for students of different health study programs to engage in complex patient-health professional conversations, offering an alternative to traditional role plays with actors or real patients. Methods: This study utilized a GPT-4 based digital teaching assistant, implemented through a proprietary chatbot design platform, to train anamnesis interviews in virtual settings with students from different online health care study programs. Students’ satisfaction, virtual patient’s accuracy, its realism, and quality were evaluated with a quantitative survey. Results: The evaluation of the bot focused on student feedback, highlighting a preference for the AI-driven method due to its immersive and interactive nature. Preliminary results show that students consistently rate the language ability of the AI model positively. More than 80% of students rated the professional and content-related precision of the virtual patient as good to excellent. Even as a text-based chatbot, the vast majority of students see a fairly close to very close relationship to a real anamnesis interview. The results further indicate that students even prefer this training approach to traditional in-person role-plays. Conclusions: The study underscores the bot’s potential as a versatile tool for enriching learning experiences across multiple health disciplines, signaling a meaningful shift in educational practices towards the integration of AI technologies. © The Author(s) 2025.","Anamnesis interview; Artificial intelligence patients; ChatGPT; Health professionals; Large language model; Medical education; Self-directed learning","Artificial Intelligence; Education, Distance; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Role Playing; Surveys and Questionnaires; artificial intelligence; distance learning; female; human; interview; male; questionnaire; role playing","","","","","IU International University of Applied Sciences","This work was supported by IU International University of Applied Sciences Incubator funding (Ref.

Against this backdrop, AI-driven music composition techniques have also produced significant progress. However, no existing model has yet demonstrated the capability to generate Chinese-style music corresponding to Chinese-style videos. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel Chinese-style video music generation model based on the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model generates Chinese-style music from Chinese-style videos and achieves performance comparable to the baseline models in audio quality, distribution fitting, musicality, rhythmic stability, and audio-visual synchronization.

This approach is designed to facilitate the creation of novel designs for traditional blue calico patterns. To address the shortcomings of existing style transfer models, including the generation of blurry details, poor texture and color effects, and excessive model parameters, we propose the incorporation of the Ghost convolution module and the SRM attention module into the generator network structure. This approach aims to reduce the model parameter quantity and computational cost while enhancing the feature extraction ability of the network. The experimental results demonstrate that the method proposed in this paper not only effectively enhances the content details, texture, and color effects of the generated images, but also successfully combines traditional blue calico with modern daily necessities, thereby enhancing its appeal to young people. This research provides novel insights into the digital protection and innovative development of traditional culture, and illustrates the extensive potential applications of deep learning technology in the field of cultural heritage. © The Author(s) 2025.","Blue calico; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Image style migration","applied research; article; artificial intelligence; color; controlled study; deep learning; feature extraction; generative adversarial network; generator; human; inheritance","","","","","Google China Education Cooperation Project Funding Program, (PJ240022)","This project is made possible by the 2024 Google China Education Cooperation Project Funding Program (No. PJ240022).","Gao X., The value of new media art in intangible cultural heritage, Int.

Traditional 3D modeling methods are resource-intensive, while recent advances in Neural Rendering (NR) have introduced efficient and automated solutions. In the fashion industry, where visual fidelity and rapid prototyping are crucial, NR techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are becoming relevant resources to digitize complex geometries and textures with a low-cost approach, enabling different applications like virtual fitting rooms, immersive e-commerce, and digital prototyping. However, the evaluation of their effectiveness in this field is still in its early phases. To address the industry's needs, we propose Fashion immersive Neural Rendering Interface (FENRI), a novel framework that integrates NR techniques for reconstructing 3D models from 2D images of fashion items. FENRI includes a WebXR-based visualization platform that allows immersive comparison and evaluation of NR-generated 3D models, supporting both experts and non-experts in selecting optimal designs. We applied FENRI to footwear design, collecting a novel dataset to compare NeRF and 3DGS methods through quantitative and qualitative analyses. In our study, the 3DGS method demonstrated superior performance over NeRF, as highlighted by the higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values (37.65 vs. 29.03, respectively) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) scores (0.99 vs 0.96), while exhibiting a lower Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) values (0.01 vs 0.04). Moreover, we showed that, by applying classical mesh post-processing techniques, we can increase the topological and visual quality of the 3D models synthesized by NR methods. These findings highlight the potential of NR techniques in the fashion industry's digital pipeline. By enabling rapid, immersive, and visually compelling design iterations, FENRI offers a scalable solution to the fashion industry's demand for high-quality 3D reconstructions, promoting innovation and sustainability. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence system; Deep learning; Fashion garment design; Immersive visualization; Neural Rendering","Garment industry; Gaussian noise (electronic); Visualization; Artificial intelligence systems; Deep learning; Fashion garment design; Fashion industry; Garment design; Gaussians; Immersive; Immersive visualization; Neural rendering; Three dimensional modelling; Rendering (computer graphics)","","","","","","","Balloni E., Gorgoglione L., Paolanti M., Mancini A., Pierdicca R., Few shot photogrametry: A comparison between NERF and MVS-SFM for the documentation of cultural heritage, Int.
